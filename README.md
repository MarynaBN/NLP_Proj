# NLP_Proj

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying tweets to determine whether they are ironic or not.
Importance of the conducted project:
Irony detection is a challenging task in NLP due to the subtle and context-dependent nature of irony.
Accurate irony detection can improve the understanding of sentiments in social media analysis.

# Our objective:
Utilize a dataset of tweets labeled as ironic or non-ironic to develop a model that can predict irony in tweets.

# Dataset Description

Source:
Dataset was provided by the "tweet_eval" library.
Our focus:
We specifically used the "irony" subset of the dataset.
Labels used:
Two labels: Ironic and Non-ironic tweets.
Dataset Size:
Total number of tweets in the subset: 7000

Preprocessing is crucial to clean and normalize the text data for better model performance.

# Text Preprocessing Overview

Steps Involved:
1. Lowercasing
2. Removing URLs and hashtags
3. Lemmatization
4. Removing punctuation
5. Removing stopwords
